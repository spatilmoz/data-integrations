# XMatters

TODO: More documentation

Two APIs for XMatters as of this writing (20180214). The old one:

https://help.xmatters.com/OnDemand/xmodwelcome/communicationplanbuilder/appendixrestapi.htm

which is for sites, and the new one:

https://help.xmatters.com/xmAPI/?python

which is for OAuth, People, and the rest.

Expects a config file called `secrets_xmatters.py` which looks like this:
```
config = {
  'proxies'      : {},
  'xm_client_id' : 'CLIENT-ID-HERE',
  'xm_username'  : 'USERNAMEHERE',
  'xm_password'  : 'PASSWORDHERE',
}
```
